= Introduction =

The DHCP Protocol is not very explicit in the exact implementation of DHCP Clients when receiving DHCP Offer messages from DHCP Servers. The protocol does not make clear how the DHCPClient should choose between offers. This attack method assumes that the client merely replies to the first available offer, and thus tries to be the first.

= Details =

As soon as a DHCP Discover message is received, instead of processing the request like a normal full fledged DHCP Server should, the rouge dhcp server should immediately broadcast a pre-calculated offer message, using the same xid (transaction id) of the discoverying client.
